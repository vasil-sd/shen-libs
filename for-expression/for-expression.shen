'for' is a macro that provides scala-like 'for expressions'.
http://www.scala-lang.org/node/111 (also known as 'for comprehensions')



Example 1:
==========

The last element is returned.

(for 1)

=> 1



Example 2:
==========

A generator.

(for A <- [1 2]
     A)

=> [1 2]



Example 3:
==========

Two generators.

(for A <- [1 2]
     B <- [a b]
     [A B])

=> [[1 a] [1 b] [2 a] [2 b]]



Example 4:
==========

A guard.

(for A <- [1 2]
     B <- [a b]
     if (= A 1)
     [A B])
=> [[1 a] [1 b]]



Example 5:
==========

Similarly to example 4, this example uses
two expressions and a guard. But
by moving the guard one step up, the
expression computes slightly more efficiently.
The result is the same.

(for A <- [1 2]
     if (= A 1)
     B <- [a b]
     [A B])
=> [[1 a] [1 b]]




Example 6:
==========

Local variable

(for A <- [1 2]
     B <- [a b]
     C = [A B]
     C)



Example 7: 
==========

Pattern matching.

(for [A B] <- [[1 2][3 4]]
     (* A B))
=> [2 12]


Example 9:
==========

Pattern matching with strings.
(Pattern matching also works with tuples
and vectors)

(for (@s A B) <- ["ab" "cd" "de"]
     [A B])
=>
[["a" "b"] ["c" "d"] ["d" "e"]]
