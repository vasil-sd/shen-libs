This is a repository of experimental Shen libraries.

Shen is modern rapidly developing programming language (more precisely - 
metalanguage) created by Dr. Mark Tarver for all modern platforms (Python, 
JavaScript, Scheme, Common Lisp and many others).
It combines functional programming, pattern-matching, compiler-compiler, 
declarative programming (almost one-to-one as in prolog) the most powerful 
type system in one single, and a compact and crossplatform core.
You may found more information about it on site http://www.lambdassociates.org

If you want to share your code with other Shen users then write to 
vasil.s.d AT gmail.com for details how to do it.

Your patches, suggestions, remarks are always welcome.
