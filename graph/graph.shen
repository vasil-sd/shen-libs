*** Commentary:

Graphs are represented as two dictionaries one for vertices and one
for edges.  It is important to note that the dictionary implementation
used is able to accept arbitrary data structures as keys.  This
structure technically encodes hypergraphs (a generalization of graphs
in which each edge may contain any number of vertices).  Examples of a
regular graph G and a hypergraph H with the corresponding data
structure are given below.
